Currency Converter values user privacy and is committed to enhancing the app's user experience.

Data Collection:
Our Currency Converter app does not collect any personal or sensitive information from users, except for basic information necessary for the functionality of the app, such as internet availability status.

Internet Availability:
The app may check for internet availability solely for the purpose of providing you with real-time exchange rates. No personal information is transmitted or stored during this process.
Additionally, this information may be used to automatically enable an offline mode within the app, ensuring continued functionality even in the absence of an internet connection.
In offline mode, the app will utilize locally stored data to perform currency conversions, maintaining a seamless user experience without compromising privacy or security.
